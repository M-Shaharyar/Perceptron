# 🧠 Perceptron Implementation in Python

This project demonstrates the **Perceptron algorithm** (both custom implementation and Scikit-learn’s version) applied on datasets and logic gates. It also includes visualizations of the decision boundaries and training process using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

---

## 📌 Features
- Implementation of **Perceptron algorithm from scratch**
- Training with **Scikit-learn’s Perceptron**
- **Visualization** of:
  - Decision boundaries
  - Training process (animated using `FuncAnimation`)
- Application of perceptron on:
  - **Custom datasets**
  - **Logic gates (AND, OR, XOR)**

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- **placement.csv** → Sample dataset used for perceptron training  
- **Perceptron.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step implementation  
- **Python scripts** inside notebook:
  - Perceptron implementation (multiple versions)
  - Step activation function
  - Decision boundary plotting
  - Logic gate perceptron models

## ⚙️ Requirements
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:


## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn mlxtend

git clone https://github.com/your-username/perceptron.git
cd perceptron

jupyter notebook Perceptron.ipynb

```

## ▶️ Run Instructions
Run all cells in the notebook to:  
- Load dataset  
- Train perceptron  
- Visualize results  

---

## 📊 Visualizations
- Decision boundary plots  
- Training animation of perceptron weights updating  
- Logic gate truth tables visualized with decision regions  

---

## 🧩 Logic Gates
The perceptron is trained on truth tables of:  
- **AND Gate** ✅ (linearly separable)  
- **OR Gate** ✅ (linearly separable)  
- **XOR Gate** ❌ (not linearly separable, demonstrates limitation of perceptron)  

---

## 🖼️ Example Outputs
- Scatterplots with decision boundaries  
- Animation of perceptron training process  
- Visualizations of AND/OR/XOR classification
