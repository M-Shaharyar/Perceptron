# 🧠 Perceptron Implementation in Python

This project demonstrates the **Perceptron algorithm** (both custom implementation and Scikit-learn’s version) applied on datasets and logic gates. It also includes visualizations of the decision boundaries and training process using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

---

## 📌 Features
- Implementation of **Perceptron algorithm from scratch**
- Training with **Scikit-learn’s Perceptron**
- **Visualization** of:
  - Decision boundaries
  - Training process (animated using `FuncAnimation`)
- Application of perceptron on:
  - **Custom datasets**
  - **Logic gates (AND, OR, XOR)**

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- **placement.csv** → Sample dataset used for perceptron training  
- **Perceptron.ipynb** → Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step implementation  
- **Python scripts** inside notebook:
  - Perceptron implementation (multiple versions)
  - Step activation function
  - Decision boundary plotting
  - Logic gate perceptron models
